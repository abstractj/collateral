We've just released the next milestone of AeroGear, 1.0.0.M3b.  In this release we've created a hybrid mobile application using Apache Cordova/PhoneGap, started a Ruby/TorqueBox mobile example, further refined the core quickstart/archetype, and started work on security, and a light weight MVC for integration.
</p>
<p>
The [getting started wiki=>https://community.jboss.org/wiki/GetStartedWithHTML5MobileWebDevelopmentWithJBoss] is fully updated, and we've also added a [repository=>https://github.com/aerogear/kitchensink-cordova] and [wiki page=>https://community.jboss.org/wiki/ConvertingAnAeroGearPOH5WebAppToAHybridAppWithApacheCordova] to kickstart your Cordova application with AeroGear.  The great thing about Plain Old HTML5 (POH5) and Cordova is that nearly all of the web based functionality is the same, so our [Deep Dive wiki=>https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HTML5MobileQuickstartArchetypeDeepDive] gives you all the details you need to build your own.

With M3 we've started development into new mobile technologies, and functionality.  For M4 we'll be completing the TorqueBox example, updating the Cordova application, working on a new shopping cart example, and focusing on getting an alpha version of the security/mvc work in place.  

The M4 release will likely be a shorter release because of various reasons, so we'll get what we can in for it, and plan to have as much as possible ready by the time [JUDCon=>http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/boston] and [JBoss World=>http://www.redhat.com/summit/] comes around in June!  

A few of us will speaking at JBoss World, specifically [myself=>http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session.html#jbalunas], and Doug Campos a.k.a. [Qmx=>http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/boston/agenda/day1track2#1630].  We'll be discussing AeroGear and much of the work and features above, plus some extras!  Also as part of the [Mobile/HTML5 BOF=>http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#808] several JBoss core engineers and experts will also be discussing the future of mobile development both at Red Hat, and the larger enterprise ecosystem, so join us there!  If you want the latest, and I'm sure you do, register for [JUDCon Boston=>http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/2012/boston], and/or [JBoss World 2012=>http://www.redhat.com/summit/]!
